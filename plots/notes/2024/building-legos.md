My university's winter break is beginning to wrap up, and I ended up back in town a few
days earlier than classes start, and my plans for the week got delayed due to weather
scares. So, when a friend asked if I wanted to come over to his place and build a LEGO set,
of course I'm going to take up that offer!

We built the [Speed Champions Mercedes-AWG set](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=76909-1&name=Mercedes-AMG%20F1%20W12%20E%20Performance%20&%20Mercedes-AMG%20Project%20One&category=%5BSPEED%20CHAMPIONS%5D#T=S), and I built the Project One car while he built the F1 car!

I wish I had built more LEGO sets as a kid. It was really fun to do a project where I got to
build something physical, and use a bit of imagination to figure out how everything pieces
together. Although, doing this project made me remember how much I truly hated stickers on LEGO sets!
Why don't they pre-print decals onto the pieces? I understand cost and wanting more experimentation
and play with the blank pieces, but my perfectionism can't handle a slightly skewed sticker and it
drove me nuts!

I also didn't realize how cheap some LEGO sets could be. Someday I'd love to do the bigger sets like the
Millenium Falcon one with ~7500 pieces, but this set was 600 pieces, two cars, and only $30 USD. Not a bad
deal for someone that just wants a cool project to do in one night! 

Maybe once I move out of school housing and have my own full space I'll put up some shelves and bring back 
LEGOs into my hobby rotation. It seems to not only be a fun hobby but also something that was a good break
and relaxation project to de-stress a bit!
