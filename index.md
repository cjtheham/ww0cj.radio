üëãüèª Hello! My name is CJ, a.k.a. Rogue. I'm a web developer turned amateur radio operator turned university student. I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering at a university in the US.

I've got a ton of hobbies I'm always bouncing between, but the main ones include:

* Amateur Radio
* Film Reviewing
* Web Development
* Reading Non-Fiction

I'm also working on a few large scale projects, including [OpenHam Wiki](https://openham.wiki), [World Foam Alliance](https://worldfoamalliance.org), and a few upcoming open-source projects.
