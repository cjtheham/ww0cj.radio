<p>One of my primary hobbies is amateur radio, a hobby dedicated to furthering radio technology through experimentation and on-the-air activities. I'm passionate about both the technology as well as improving youth engagement in electronics and engineering via radio.</p>

<p>I first recieved my Technician Class license in December 2020 as KO4JZT. In April 2021 I upgraded to my General Class license and finally upgraded to Extra Class in July 2021 and got the vanity call of <b>WW0CJ</b>.</p>
