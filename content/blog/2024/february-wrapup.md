I'm a few days late, and it's been a crazy month. Between classes, sickness, and just general life it's been hard to keep up. Nevertheless, I got some cool stuff done this month! I participated in the [CQ WPX RTTY](/plots/amateur-radio/2024/wpx-rtty/) contest, hosted a major on-campus event to promote the local radio club, started a new Dungeons & Dragons campaign, and somehow managed to not fall behind on life in all of that.

## Movies 

All of my movies watched this month were also taken up by class assignments, but I got to re-watch Holes (2003) which is always a spectacular watch.

## Books

Because of class, I fell a lot behind on my reading. I meant to get more personal reading done this month, but it was a no-go. I'm hoping to spend my Spring Break this month getting one or two books knocked out!

## Video Games

My house purchased a new Xbox this month so I've gotten to get a bit more into gaming!

- Madden 24 is difficult for someone without as much sports knowledge, but I'm picking it up pretty quickly.
- Peggle 2 is an awesome game I played when I was younger and now getting to replay it is awesome.
- Sunset Overdrive is another game I played years ago and am now re-playing and having an awesome time with it.

Not as eventful of a month but hopefully the next roundup will be a bit more filled!
