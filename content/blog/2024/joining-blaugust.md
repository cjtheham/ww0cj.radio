I always love these blogging challenges that come up every year, but my schedule
never seems to be able to accomodate. I've tried 100 Days to Offload in the
past, tried writing posts during NaNoWriMo, and more, but I always seem to
ditch the challenges before I can ever finish them.

A few months ago, I encountered some people on the Fediverse prepping for this
year's Blaugust Festival, and after taking a look into it I really wanted to
participate! A few things stood out to me that made me think, this challenge
might be the one I can finish.

1. There's no hardset goals or deadlines. It's all just about encouragement
   towards writing during the month of August. I really like that level of
   flexibility!
2. It's also a huge push towards community rather than just pumping out content,
   which I also really like!
3. It's got achievements to try and work towards, and this really speaks to me
   as a completionist in my video games, let alone normal tasks like this!
4. There's a prompts list to help spark topics to write about - something I
   always struggle with deciding on for this blog.

I really encourage everyone to check out Blaugust if they're a blogger looking
to start amping up the amount of content they create, and I'm super excited to
start writing this month for this event.

And with that introduction into the festival, let's go ahead and do some
catch-up as I'm starting this a few days late into the month...whoops. Week 1,
from the 1st-3rd, covered discussions about Blaugust, spreading the event
around, and welcoming new members. I think the intro to this post takes care of
that pretty well, so let's go into Week 2's topic, introducing yourself!

For those new to my blog (which I'm sure most will be during this event), my
name is CJ. I'm a university student studying electrical engineering, hoping to
work in radio technology after graduation. I've been blogging for several years
now, although only about a year on this iteration of my sites. I mostly write
about my various hobbies: I do amateur radio (this site's URL and title comes
from my amateur radio callsign), watch and review films, mess around with
electronics projects, and build websites like this one. I also occasionally write 
from time to time about mental health and productivity, although I'm certainly 
not an expert.

Right now, I'm working on a few interesting projects that cycle through.
[OpenHam](https://openham.wiki) is a MediaWiki site dedicated to amateur radio
and radio science and technology. My goal is to have it be a database of
knowledge in a few years that any radio amateur would benefit from keeping their
eyes on, similar to how many like to keep the ARRL Handbook on their desk for
reference. Recently, I've taken an interest to parliamentary procedure and am
working on tools to help small organizations improve their documentation and
tech usage. Lastly, I've been spending my time in university working on building
a campus amateur radio club from the ground up, with the help of some of my
friends.

Over the next month, I'm not quite sure what I'll end up writing about, but I'm
sure some of the projects and interesting things about me will make their way
into the fold. I'm excited to see what I can write and come up with, and I'm
equally excited to read all the posts from others throughout the month.

Live long and prosper, and happy Blaugust!
