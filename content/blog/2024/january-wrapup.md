I'm a bit behind on 100 Days to Offload this year already, so I thought I'd take a page out of some of my favorite blogs to read (specifically [JoelChrono](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/december-2023-summary/) and [hyde](https://lazybear.io/)) in drafting up a summary of my month and the kinds of content I consumed.

In terms of accomplishments and events this month, I got some awesome opportunities:
- I got to fly out of state and see some family for the first time in a while, and I hope to take advantage of free time over the summer to see them again because it was an awesome time.
- [Built LEGOs](/plots/notes/2024/building-legos/) for the first time in a while.
- Got the organization bylaws rewrite I had been working on since the beginning of December voted on and codified.
- Brought out the local radio club's emergency communications trailer to my college campus for [Winter Field Day](https://winterfieldday.com/) and helped friends make their first on-the-air HF contacts.
- Finished my first full Dungeons & Dragons campaign as a player (Curse of Strahd), and did a Session 0 for another campaign in the same group.

I'm really proud of everything I did this month even though the month sped by really quickly. Below, I'll talk a bit about some content I consumed and my thoughts briefly.

## TV

Usually, I don't really watch TV shows since they're not my favorite medium of content. However, this month I watched the new Peacock show *ted* (a spin-off of the movies of the same name) and it was pretty good. Some raunchy humor in the style of the movies but it does a pretty good job at bringing some humor forward while also being character focused and not all jokes. I really appreciated this version and would even recommend this show over the movies.

## Movies 

At the beginning of the month, before going back to school, I decided to watch a whole bunch of movies to get some movies off my watchlist.

- BlacKkKlansman (2018) was a fantastic film with fantastic actors, and I highly recommend it if you're able to deal with the topic of racism as presented in the film.
- Burnt (2015) had a good premise, and is definitely getting some increased traction with the TV show *The Bear*, but wasn't very well executed in my opinion.
- 13 Going on 30 (2004) was a great, light-hearted rom-com with an interesting premise and I really enjoyed it.
- Now You See Me (2013) is a great premise and I love a cool magician story, but Now You See Me 2 (2016) didn't feel as well executed and only had a few real stand-out scenes.
- Hot Tub Time Machine (2010) was a little funny, but a bit too raunchy and relying on that for its humor that it fell off a bit.
- That's My Boy (2012) was an awful premise, and awful execution that was only really redeemed by a few good Adam Sandler comedy moments.
- The Proposal (2009) was another movie with an interesting concept, but no likable characters that just made me uninterested and disconnected from the film.
- Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) was a pretty cool and interesting action film. I'm really interested now in the new re-imagining that's coming out soon with Donald Glover.

I also saw the new Mean Girls movie (2024) in theaters, which was pretty good but I personally think could have done better on the casting.

You can find my more spoiler-prone reviews for all of these [here](https://letterboxd.com/roguefoam) on my Letterboxd profile.

I also started taking a class on African-American Cinema this semester, but so far we are in the transitional period between silent and sound films and I've learned over the years that I'm not a fan of silent films and don't feel like I'm watching them close enough to have a clear enough understanding to rank them.

## Books

I started reading *Good Omens* by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett at the beginning of this month, but have been struggling to get through it.

In December, I did get through *The Alchemist* by Paulo Coelho, but books are another genre and form that I don't feel as comfortable ranking and reviewing as I don't feel like I'm grasping enough to have a good idea of how to rank them.

I think I'll put some books on hold and truly focus on films for a bit. Maybe I'll try and grind out my To-Be-Read list over the summer when I have less distractions and no reading to do for school.

## Podcasts

I need to get back into listening to podcasts again, but I usually listen to one or two episodes of the [Ham Radio Crash Course Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ham-radio-crash-course-podcast/id1400794852) each month and really enjoy it. Anyone with an interest in ham radio, prepping, or that just generally wants to have a good laugh and something to play in the background will enjoy this.

I'm excited to see where February will bring me and I can continue to write these. I really enjoyed writing this one!
