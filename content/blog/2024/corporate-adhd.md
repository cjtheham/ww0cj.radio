I recently started a new remote contract job - my first one in a long time and my first one since my ADHD diagnosis. I've learned a lot about what is and isn't working for me, and I wanted to share that here.

Firstly, time commitments are seemingly a no-go. Not only was I not able to meet time commitments due to ADHD executive dysfunction, but I also had some pretty rough mental health days overall. I think task based work is much more manageable for the ADHD brain, and I think going forward I'll work more on a deadline and task basis rather than a "work 20 hours per week" basis.

I also learned that meetings SUCK. Having to go to bed, wake up the next day and recalibrate the mind to what was being worked on yesterday just to make a final decision is an absolute struggle. I have no clue how people do this effectively, and I wish instant message was more prevalent in the corporate world.

I think that the idea that's drilled into your brain that you must be productive at all times in order to give back to society is causing more damage than good in the long run, as those of us with ADHD begin to feel like failures because we can't output the same. In reality, thanks to hyperfocus, I sometimes feel like I'm outputting more than the average person would in the same amount of time. But at the same time, in my mind, I'm not putting in as many hours so I must not be as good of a worker as the guy that's able to sit down and put in 60 hours as week.

For better ADHD accomodations in the workplace, I think we as a society need to move closer to self-autonomy and task based infrastructure. Give me a to-do list, a deadline, and a way to contact you with questions and send me on my way!
