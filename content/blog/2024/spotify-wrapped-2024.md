title: Spotify Wrapped 2024

I'm not the biggest fan of the Spotify platform, but I use it due to its cheap student pricing while I'm in university. I *used* to love the Spotify Wrapped results, because the presentation was always really cool and it clearly showed a lot of time, creativity, and devotion to the project from the developers. Unfortunately, this year felt like more of a bust - there was very little information presented outside of the basics and it seemed very driven by generative AI for some very random descriptions of your listening habits. Nonetheless, I wanted to share the results of my Spotify Wrapped here both for long-term storage in the future (to compare my listening habits down the line) and just for a general blost.

If you've got any music suggestions, please feel free to share! I'd love to check them out! I want to listen to more music in my free time in 2025, as I think it's a great tool to help with focus that I don't really take advantage of much!
