A bit of a late monthly wrapup here, but the delay was necessary! It has been an insane month with a ton of major life events and trying to catch up on schoolwork, but we're here now and things are finally beginning to cool down. 

In terms of actual events happening though, not much went on this month. I taught a brief (1-hour) session on Robert's Rules of Order for an organization I'm in, attended Day 1 of FediForum (a bit salty I couldn't attend Day 2...), and got to check out my university's TEDx talks. 

I'm excited to get into the month of April, with the eclipse coming up and some travel the following month it will certainly be a busy next few months!

## Movies

Almost all of the movies I watched this month were for class, so I haven't had much time to watch movies for myself. Just about the only things I watched for myself were:

- Dune: Part 2 (2024) - I actually got to see this twice thanks to my AMC A-List subscription making it free, and it was a great time to watch it twice. It is nice when a movie is as in-depth as this to go back and look for hidden gems. On the second watch, I paid more attention to the soundtrack and it's amazing!
- Late Night with the Devil (2024) - Very low-level introductory horror, and a bit of a drama farm with all the AI commentary surrounding this film on the internet right now. I enjoyed it though, certainly didn't regret going!
- Ricky Stanicky (2024) - John Cena does comedy really well, but overall this is very much a middle of the road, "turn your brain off" type of movie.

As we're getting into April I'm already watching more films for myself, so hopefully this is more in-depth next month!

## Books

The only reading I've done this month is restarting the Dune book - watching Part 2 and hearing commentary from friends about how different it is from the books made me want to go back and read it in full. Last time I tried, I only got maybe 100-150 pages through, so hopefully I can finish the whole thing this time.

I'm excited to get more into writing this year and continue 100 Days to Offload with this post. I feel like I've been neglecting this blog for a couple of months now, and really wish to turn that around! Stay tuned for some (hopefully) cool content coming in the near future.
