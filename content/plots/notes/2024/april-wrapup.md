Compared to last month, I'm actually doing a pretty good job at getting this post out in a timely manner - although I'm still a few days late. Also as per usual, it's been a crazy month for me in my personal life so not a ton worth writing about in a single blog post happened, but hopefully I can make some better posts down the line as well!

In terms of some major events of the month, I got to:
- Attend the Tulsa, OK "Severe Weather Awareness Expo" where I represented the local radio club and their severe weather preparedness-related activities.
- Spent a day in Russellville, AR to watch the total solar eclipse (hopefully I'll get around to writing a post about this soon!)
- Spent a weekend hanging out with friends on the lake as a nice break from classes and homework
- Registered and started preparing for the Fall 2024 semester of university.

Next month, my primary activity outside of finishing the academic year is a roadtrip to Dayton Hamvention - the largest ham radio convention in the USA. This'll be my second time attending, so I hope to have some fun stories and photos to share here after the trip is over.

## Movies

I forced myself to watch a few extra movies in my personal time this month, and I hope to continue that going forward now that I'm done with watching movies for class.

- High Fidelity (2000) was pretty depressing honestly, but it might just be a movie that I'm not at a stage of life to appreciate.
- We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011) was also pretty depressing, and also very intense.
- Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) is one of the better rom-coms I've watched recently.
- Legally Blonde (2001) is a classic for me, but something I hadn't watched in several years so I was excited to watch it again.
- Silver Linings Playbook (2012) was a fantastic movie with a hint of romance but with the focus lying elsewhere. I really enjoyed watching this, and it was my favorite movie I watched for myself this month.

I also watched Moonlight (2016) and Get Out (2017) for class, which were both absolutely fantastic films that I'd highly recommend and hope to rewatch without the burden of academics on top of them, simply to enjoy.

## Books

At the beginning of the month I tried to re-read Frank Herbert's *Dune*, but I keep losing the little free time I have to try and sit down and read to school and projects and everything else I've got going on. 

I'm going to bring *Dune* with me on my roadtrip next month and hopefully when I've got some hotel downtime I can give it a read. I've also got a few other books queued up that I'm excited for, but I just need to get a better reading habit going.

## Conclusion

While I won't go too much into the goings on of my personal life here, I think that April was a really great month for me to not only discover more about myself but also to just take in life. It's been a bit stressful with a few things popping up here and there, but I really just spent the majority of my time present in the moment and trying to figure things out and I think it really worked out for the better. I'm super excited to enter summer and see where the rest of 2024 takes me, and I'm excited to continue to learn and grow throughout the year.
