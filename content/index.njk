<p>I've got a ton of hobbies I'm always bouncing between, but the main ones include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amateur Radio</li>
  <li>Film Reviewing</li>
  <li>Web Development</li>
  <li>Reading Non-Fiction</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm also working on a few large scale projects, including <a href="https://openham.wiki">OpenHam Wiki</a>, <a href="https://worldfoamalliance.org">World Foam Alliance</a>, and a few upcoming open-source projects.</p>
